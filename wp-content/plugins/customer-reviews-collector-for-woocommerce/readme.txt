**How the intelligent invitation system works:**

* In the review invitations we switch the platform’s link to star ratings.
* If your client chooses 1, 2 or 3 stars, we do not redirect them to write a review right away. Instead, we offer the option to contact your customer support directly to resolve the issue.
* But if they choose to give you 4 or 5 stars, we redirect them to a link to share their feedback on your company!

### Which platform is best to collect reviews?

**It's best to collect your reviews on Google.**

If you set a physical address in your Google Business account, Google will display your business on Google Maps. And if you are in the top 3 results for your location on Google Maps, it will send potential customers in your way for free.

**Ranking high on Google Maps can boost your income by up to 70% without increasing your expenses.**

### Why are Google reviews important for your business?

* Ranking No.1 in your industry on Google Maps leads to more clients
* 87% of customers rely on online reviews when purchasing a product or service, so it's essential to get excellent Google reviews
* Displaying your Google reviews on your website can increase conversion rates by 17% on average
